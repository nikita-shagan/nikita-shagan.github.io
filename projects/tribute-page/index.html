                <h3>Adiyogi. How the science of yoga was bestowed upon the world.</h3>
                <p>More than 15,000 years ago, at a time before all religion, Adiyogi, the first yogi, passed on the science of yoga to his seven disciples, Saptarishi. ⠀</p>
                <p>Yoga is widely practiced today simply as a form of physical exercise, however yoga is much more than that. This is the technology of raising vital energies to the very peak and turning the human system into a ladder to the divine. To achieve this, Adiyogi outlined 112 ways in which a person can overcome his limitations and realize his ultimate potential.⠀</p>
                <p>Today we call this being Shiva. But in the yogic culture, Shiva is not regarded as a God, but as an Adiyogi or the First Yogi. It was he who first put this seed into the human mind. More than fifteen thousand years ago, Shiva achieved his full enlightenment and immersed himself in an intense ecstatic dance in the Himalayas. When his ecstasy allowed him to move, he danced wildly. When it became too much, he became completely motionless.⠀</p>
                <p>People saw that he was experiencing something that no one had known before, something that they could not understand. Interest was growing, and people wanted to know what it was. They came, they waited and left with nothing, because he did not notice the presence of other people being either in an intense dance or in absolute immobility. Soon everyone left except for seven people.</p>
                <p>They insisted on getting knowledge, but Shiva ignored them. They begged him, "Please, we want to know what you know." Shiva sent them saying, "You are fools. Being who you are now, you won't understand anything in a million years. This requires a huge amount of preparation."⠀</p>
                <p>They began to prepare. Day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year. On the day of the full moon, after eighty-four years of sadhana, when the solstice passed from summer to winter, Adiyogi looked at these seven people and saw that they had turned into shining vessels of knowledge. They were ready. ⠀</p>
                <p>Over the next few days, he kept a close eye on them, and when the next full moon came, he decided to become a Guru. Adiogi turned into Adi Guru this day, today is known as Guru Purnima. On the shore of Kanti Sarovar, a lake that is a few kilometers above Kedarnath, he turned south to shed his mercy on the human race, and the transmission of the science of yoga began. Yoga science is not about the yoga classes that you practice - about how to bend your body, or how to hold your breath. This is the science of understanding the entire human system.</p>
                <blockquote cite="https://isha.sadhguru.org/mahashivratri/shiva/adiyogi-the-first-yogi-more-than-a-man/">There is no culture that did not benefit from Adiyogi's science of yoga.
                    Yoga went everywhere - not as a religion, belief system,
                    or philosophy, but as methods.</blockquote>
